# SAM Image Segmentation

This project demonstrates how to use the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from the `ultralytics` library for image segmentation. The script downloads an image, applies SAM to perform segmentation, and saves the segmented image locally.

## Features
- Download an image from a URL.
- Perform image segmentation using the SAM model.
- Annotate and visualize the segmentation results.
- Save the segmented image locally.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `ultralytics` (for the SAM model)
- `supervision` (for handling detection annotations)
- `opencv-python` (for image reading, saving, and processing)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting images)

### Install dependencies

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
